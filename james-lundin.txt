    The first step is to fork the Lambda repository to your own account, then add your TL to your version as a collaborator, then you want to clone the repository from your account to your local. Once you have it locally you will create a new branch names your first-lastname, then you will work on the project commiting as needed until you are funished. Once you are finished you can push the branch to your github using git push -u origin james-lundin which will actually create the branch on github. Then you will go to github and create a pull request but you must change the master to your personal master not Lambdas so basically you are taking your branch and making a pull request to your master, before you submit it you have to add your TL as a reviewer.


Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    An inline element only takes up the width that it needs or that it contains, a block element takes up 100% of the width of its parent.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    An absolute positioned element is removed from the flow of the document and placed where you say based on top, bottom, left, or right property values provided. This will cause the element to be on top or behind other elements based on its z-index value
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    display: inline-block; 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Display block: <p> <div> <h1>
    Display inline: <span> <button> <input>
    Display inline-block: <img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The box model is that an element is the size of it's content plus the padding plus the border plus the margin. So when you apply width to an element it may actually be bigger than you specify because the padding border and margin can make it bigger. This can be fixed by specifing "border-box" as the value of box-model, border-box will make the width of an item include the other factors so when you specify width: 600; and padding: 10; the content would be 590px wide so that the padding will fit inside the width of 600.
